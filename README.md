# FAQ
How do I replace the colors?
- The accent colors should be near the top of the file, ya gotta replace the contained hex values with the ones you want

How do I replace/get rid of the Background?
- Open Notepad (or any text editor of your choice)
- Find the String "background image"
- You should now be right where the image link to the background goes. This has to be a image file, not some indirect link (if you simply delete the string, it'll be replaced with whatever you have "sec_bg_color" set to)
